LoadUp is rolling out a new service, cat and dog sitting. The product requirements are as follows:


1. A form to collect bookings that takes:

  a. First Name

  b. Last Name

  c. Animal Name

  d. Animal Type (Dog/Cat)

  e. Hours Requested (min 2, max 8)

  f. Date of service



2. A "pricing engine" to determine the cost of service

  a. Base charge of $20

  b. $10 additional per hour for dogs

  c. $5 additional per hour for cats



3. Display of all bookings on a separate page ("admin" pages)



4. Unit tests for the pricing engine



5. E2E (feature) tests for the booking form and admin pages



We highly value the time and effort you're placing on this task, so if you find yourself needing more time than the suggested amount, feel free to document what you weren't able to get to and what (if any) features/improvements you would add if you took more time.


Once completed, send a link to your repository to engineering@goloadup.com.


Good luck, and look forward to seeing what you've built!
